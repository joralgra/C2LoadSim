# C2LoadSim
The computation simulator is a tool designed to generate *synthetic computational load data* for training forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) and for validating scaling strategies.

The simulator aims to include a web interface and a full fledged API for experimentation. Atm there has been some prioritization done regarding improving the simulator capabilities and make it more trustworthy first.

Last simulator approaches can be run from the scenario_analysis_scripts.

The web prototype can be run using npm run at the frontend folder. It requires to run the api.py alonside it.
